# Isometric Game
  The game is written in C++ and the SDL2 library.
  ...to be honest the code is extremly bad, like unreadably bad, probably my worst code ever.
  I made this in order to get a simple grasp of isometric projection and tile picking.

  The game supports:
   - Zooming
   - Movement
   - Basic rotation (90Â° only)
   - Tile picking (including height)
  
  You also can make your own terrain using the ingame terrain editor (though don't expect anything advanced):

# Controls
  Sadly there is no UI, so you'll have to use your keyboard and mouse for everything, here are the controls:
